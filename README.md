# Python3 Keylogger
Simple Python3 keylogger using pyinput class.<br> 
<b>Created for personal and academic purposes!!!</b>

Usage is really simple. To check how it works just open it on background in one terminal and tail the log file in<br>another one to see how keys are logged.<br>
`python3 main.py &`<br>
`tail -f <log_file>`<br>

I will be adding more functionalities over time.<br>
